# 📚 Project: Recommendation System for IBM Community

This project focuses on building a **Recommendation System** using real interaction data from IBM's Watson Studio platform. The goal is to recommend articles to users based on their past behavior and similarities between articles or users.

----
## 💡 Project Overview

The recommendation system aims to answer the following questions:
- Which articles are most popular overall?
- What should we recommend to a new user?
- What should we recommend to a returning user based on their reading history?
- Can we find users that are most similar to a given user?

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

----
### 📦 Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```
pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy
```
----
### 🛠️ Installation

1- Clone the repository:

```
git clone url
cd Project-Recommendation-System
```
2- Open the notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab 

```
jupyter notebook Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb
```
----
## Testing

Some tests are included in the notebook using assertion checks to verify correct implementation of key functions.

- 🔍 Breakdown of Tests
User-User Similarity Tests – Check if the most similar users are correctly identified.

Recommendations Tests – Ensure that recommended article IDs match expectations.

Cluster Assignments – Verify that articles are correctly mapped to clusters.

Submission Check – Export notebook and ensure outputs are correctly formatted.

----
## 📌 Project Instructions

The notebook includes the following sections:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Understand the structure of the user-item interactions.
- **Rank-Based Recommendations** – Recommend articles based on popularity.
- **User-User Based Collaborative Filtering** – Recommend articles based on similar users.
- **Content-Based Recommendations** – Recommend articles based on clustering (e.g., KMeans).
- **Matrix Factorization (SVD)** – Use latent features to compute similarity.
- **Extras & Conclusion** – Build hybrid recommenders and polish results.
